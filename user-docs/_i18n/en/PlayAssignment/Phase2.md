## 4.3. Phase 2

During phase 2, each learner must evaluate one or more answers provided by his peers (in addition to the fake explanations you may have created when you created your question). To do so, they must...
1. ...rate each explanation they are shown on a scale from 1 (Strongly disgree) to 5 (Strongly agree).
2. ...choose again the correct answer(s) (provided the question is open ended).
3. ...provide her new confidence degree ranging from "Not confident at all" to "Totally confident"

As a teacher, you can view all the answers and evaluations anytime by refreshing the page.

When all your learners finished their evaluation phase, click on "Stop phase 2". If you chose "Distance" as you execution contect, phase 3 will automatically follow for each learner without any need for you to intervene.

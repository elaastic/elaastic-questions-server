# elaastic

_elaastic_ is an interactive system dedicated to the orchestration of formative assessment sequences during face-to-face
or distance learning.        
_elaastic_ is developed in the context of research
conducted by
the [TALENT team at IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/en/departement/dep-interaction-collective-intelligence/talent-team/) on
the design and implementation of formative
assessment systems.

## Getting started

_elaastic_ is developed with the spring-boot framework and the Kotlin language.

### Prerequisites

* Java (version 17)
* Gradle
* Docker

### Launching the database & cas servers

Initially you need build containers, what can be done with this command :

````
docker-compose up
````

Afterward, you can manage the different related services separately with the `docker-compose` commands
(`docker-compose start <service>`, `docker-compose stop <service>`, ...)

#### Services description

| Service name                 | Description                                                     |
|:-----------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------| 
| elaastic-questions-db-8      | mySQL 8 Database used for running elaastic                      |
| elaastic-questions-db-test-8 | mySQL 8 Database used for running integration tests             |
| cas                          | a CAS server just for testing CAS integration in dev mode       |
| cas-2                        | another CAS server for testing multiple CAS servers integration |


### Launching the application

To launch the application in development mode:

````
gradle bootRun
````

The application is then accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Deploying the application

_elaastic_ can be deployed in _stand-alone_ mode (with an embedded Tomcat server) or in a Tomcat server.

### Packaging the application in _stand-alone_ mode

````
gradle bootJar
````

Get the `elaastic-questions-server.jar` file from the `build/libs` folder.

It is possible to test this packaged mode by running the services in the `docker-compose-standalone.yml` file.
The application will be available at `http://localhost:8081/elaastic-questions`.

### Packaging the application for Tomcat

````
gradle bootWar
````

Get the `elaastic-questions-server.war` file from the `build/libs`folder.

It is possible to test the package for Tomcat by running the services in the `docker-compose.tomcat.yml` file.
The application will be available at `http://localhost:8088`.
       
### Setup the dockerized CAS servers in dev mode
 The generated autosigned certificate must be imported on the JDK used to launch elaastic.

From `JAVA_HOME`, run the following command :
``` 
.\bin\keytool.exe -importcert -cacerts -alias "elaastic-cas" -file <elaastic-questions-server>\docker-resources\cas\etc\cas\config\elaastic-cas-certificate.cer
```
